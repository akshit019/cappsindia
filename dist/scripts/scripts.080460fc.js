CAPPS will help to realize this by strengthening the mechanisms via budget analysis and advocacy so that common people can hold governments accountable in the developing world. In this, CAPPS will focus at the district and block levels, so that a bottom up approach can be encouraged. More specifically, CAPPS will provide technical assistance and coordination to strengthen the capacity of local civil society organizations (CSOs). The reason being, CAPPS sincerely believes that it is the CSOs who should be specially trained to monitor and analyze government expenditure choices, processes and impacts to advocate for improvements so that the scarce public resources are used more effectively. Using budget as a tool, the CSOs can, in turn, ensure that there are minimum or no leakage , better and more targeting of the disadvantaged groups (especially the SC,ST, Dalits, Children and Women in particular) and increased cost-effectiveness. <br><br> A pertinent question at this juncture is why would CAPPS focus at the CSOs in particular? It is important to understand and perhaps agree that even in a perfect democracy individual citizens lack time, resources and above all the technical skill to monitor elected officials and the actions of the government for better governance. Examples from worldwide, especially in the OECD region, have shown that it is the CSOs who can bridge the gap between the government and the individual citizen and the disadvantaged groups. Empowering CSOs would therefore create a space for generating information, analysis and ideas for the much needed case specific policy reforms- simply because one size cannot be fit for all. <br><br> Added to the above, CAPPS also believes that analyzing budgets and spreading awareness on budgets for better service delivery may not be sufficient for bringing about critical changes in budgetary policies and process in the country, more so at the sub-national levels. The reason being, even if we are able to generate adequate research findings to influence policies in any specific sector or issue, the main hindrance towards reforms is the typical systematic inheritance of the lack of urgency on the part of the key policy actors. Naturally, without strong and sustained advocacy initiatives the larger goal would be jeopardized. Therefore, parallelly with the technical support for analyzing budgets, CAPPS also intends to make dents in the process with a well-designed systematic advocacy providing wider space for the common people to participate in the policy discussion. Thus, focusing on the pro-poor and pro-marginalized budgetary and policy issues, CAPPS intends to empower a wide range of stakeholders and build considerable pressure on the elected forums to reorient policy priorities in favour of the poor and marginalized sections. </div> </div> </div> <div class="section"> <div class="container"> <div class="row heading wow bounceInUp"> GOALS </div> <div class="row wow slideInLeft" data-wow-duration="0.8s"> <ul class="collection with-header"> <li class="collection-item"> Develop district and block level hubs of CSOs interested in this work.

Therefore, the coordination should be at multiple levels. Naturally, simply producing persuasive analysis will not be sufficient unless encouraged to better leverage other ‘accountability mechanisms’ such as the news media, courts, legislators and other CSOs. CAPPS will deliver towards this direction.It must be noted at this juncture that, CAPPS has the advantage of being headquartered in the heart of Kolkata having all possible avenues for better communication and promotion of public relations. </li> <li class="collection-item">CAPPS intends to encourage the mode of engagement through accumulation and dissemination of information, rather than taking a confrontation mode. Using these means, CAPPS with an attempt to make actual collaboration with public officials. Needless to mention that, if the public officials could be made active for analytical work by fully understanding the thinking behind such analysis it would add value to the vision and mission of CAPPS in several ways. For example, they might acknowledge the reliability of such interventions and response more pro-actively. Instances are there where simply generating reports by outside organization without proper stakeholding of the partners often failed to generate the desired outcome.</li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> <!-- <div class="section wow bounceInUp">\n	<div class="container">\n		<div class="row heading">\n			OUTPUTS\n		</div>\n\n		<div class="row wow slideInRight" data-wow-duration="0.8s">\n			<ul class="collection with-header">\n		        <li class="collection-item">\n		        	Capacity building both at individual and institutional level related to budget and policy paradigm.\n		        </li>\n		        <li class="collection-item">\n		        	Generate internationally comparable information on resource mobilization and expenditure management, targeted beneficiary, effectiveness and policy reforms in the social space.

Not really.<br><br> To explain, it can be safely said that the new trend in the participatory democracy during last decade has been to define and implement the concepts of social accountability, which include, participatory budgeting, tracking public expenditure, monitoring of public service delivery, and investigative journalism, public commissions and citizen boards among other things. This trend has been developed in order to influence the priorities of a government of a federal country or a state for spending from government exchequers and monitoring expenditures. Donor agencies interested in making social investments for a better and just society have started supporting the process of social accountability.<br><br> The basic understanding of social accountability is to rely on the process of civic engagement, where the citizens and the civil society organizations take part in various ways in exacting accountability. Many people consider electoral process as an instrument, although this does not enable citizens to take part in government decision making or hold government officials accountable for government planning and spending. And this will ensure the benefit of those people who are mostly dependent on government services and do not have the capability to hold government officials accountable for planning and spending. Budget advocacy comes under this process of social accountability and it’s main objective is to influence the change in policy, change the decision-making system and empower people to make change.<br><br> By integrating these objectives budget advocacy groups can create impact on government’s functions and in turn, on people’s lives. With this broad objective we propose to form the Centre for Advocacy and Public Policy Studies, Kolkata. </div> </div> </div> <div class="section" ng-controller="Homecontroller"> <div class="container"> <div class="row heading wow bounceInUp"> WHAT WE DO </div> <div class="content wow slideInLeft" data-wow-duration="0.8s"> <div class="row" style="margin-top: 5%"> <div class="col m3 s12 center-align"> <i class="fa fa-building fa-5x" aria-hidden="true" style="color: #1e88e5"></i> <p>Capital Building Related to Budget and Policy Paradigm</p> </div> <div class="col m3 s12 center-align"> <i class="fa fa-pie-chart fa-5x" aria-hidden="true" style="color: #1e88e5"></i> <p>Information on Resource Mobilization and Expenditure Management</p> </div> <div class="col m3 s12 center-align"> <i class="fa fa-connectdevelop fa-5x" aria-hidden="true" style="color: #1e88e5"></i> <p>Building a Strong Network of Local Civil Society Organizations</p> </div> <div class="col m3 s12 center-align"> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o fa-5x" aria-hidden="true" style="color: #1e88e5"></i> <p>Periodic Assessments of Impacts for an End-Ouput Evaluation</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="section" ng-controller="Homecontroller"> <div class="container"> <div class="row heading wow bounceInUp"> WHAT WE HAVE </div> <div class="content wow slideInLeft" data-wow-duration="0.8s"> Currently CAPPS has a dedicated team of skilled individuals committed to social change as envisioned above.
