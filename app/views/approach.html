			Good governance requires both demand side intervention in the form of sustained domestic demand for good governance and supply side interventions in terms of policy and institutional reforms. CAPPS will help to realize this by strengthening the mechanisms via budget analysis and advocacy so that common people can hold governments accountable  in the developing world. In this, CAPPS will focus at the district and block levels, so that a bottom up approach can be encouraged. More specifically, CAPPS will provide technical assistance and coordination to strengthen the capacity of local civil society organizations (CSOs). The reason being, CAPPS sincerely believes that it is the CSOs who should be specially trained to monitor and analyze government expenditure choices, processes and impacts to advocate for improvements so that the scarce public resources are used more effectively. Using budget as a tool, the CSOs can, in turn, ensure that  there are minimum or no leakage , better and more targeting of the disadvantaged groups (especially the SC,ST, Dalits, Children and Women in particular) and increased cost-effectiveness.
			<br><br>
			A pertinent question at this juncture is why would CAPPS focus at the CSOs in particular? It is important to understand and perhaps agree that even in a perfect democracy individual citizens lack time, resources and above all the technical skill to monitor elected officials and the actions of the government for better governance. Examples from worldwide, especially in the OECD region, have shown that it is the CSOs who can bridge the gap between the government and the individual citizen and the disadvantaged groups. Empowering CSOs would therefore create a space for generating information, analysis and ideas for the much needed case specific policy reforms- simply because one size cannot be fit for all.
			<br><br>
			Added to the above, CAPPS also believes that analyzing budgets and spreading awareness on budgets for better service delivery may not be sufficient for bringing about critical changes in budgetary policies and process in the country, more so at the sub-national levels. The reason being, even if we are able to generate adequate research findings to influence policies in any specific sector or issue, the main hindrance towards reforms is the typical systematic inheritance of the lack of urgency on the part of the key policy actors. Naturally, without strong and sustained advocacy initiatives the larger goal would be jeopardized. Therefore, parallelly with the technical support for analyzing budgets, CAPPS also intends to make dents in the process with a well-designed systematic advocacy providing wider space for the common people to participate in the policy discussion. Thus, focusing on the pro-poor and pro-marginalized budgetary and policy issues, CAPPS intends to empower a wide range of stakeholders and build considerable pressure on the elected forums to reorient policy priorities in favour of the poor and marginalized sections.
