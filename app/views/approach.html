			OUR APPROACH

			Good governance requires both demand side intervention in the form of sustained domestic demand for good governance and supply side interventions in terms of policy and institutional reforms. CAPPS will help to realize this by strengthening the mechanisms via budget analysis and advocacy so that common people can hold governments accountable  in the developing world. In this, CAPPS will focus at the district and block levels, so that a bottom up approach can be encouraged. More specifically, CAPPS will provide technical assistance and coordination to strengthen the capacity of local civil society organizations (CSOs). The reason being, CAPPS sincerely believes that it is the CSOs who should be specially trained to monitor and analyze government expenditure choices, processes and impacts to advocate for improvements so that the scarce public resources are used more effectively. Using budget as a tool, the CSOs can, in turn, ensure that  there are minimum or no leakage , better and more targeting of the disadvantaged groups (especially the SC,ST, Dalits, Children and Women in particular) and increased cost-effectiveness.
			<br><br>
			A pertinent question at this juncture is why would CAPPS focus at the CSOs in particular? It is important to understand and perhaps agree that even in a perfect democracy individual citizens lack time, resources and above all the technical skill to monitor elected officials and the actions of the government for better governance. Examples from worldwide, especially in the OECD region, have shown that it is the CSOs who can bridge the gap between the government and the individual citizen and the disadvantaged groups. Empowering CSOs would therefore create a space for generating information, analysis and ideas for the much needed case specific policy reforms- simply because one size cannot be fit for all.
			<br><br>
			Added to the above, CAPPS also believes that analyzing budgets and spreading awareness on budgets for better service delivery may not be sufficient for bringing about critical changes in budgetary policies and process in the country, more so at the sub-national levels. The reason being, even if we are able to generate adequate research findings to influence policies in any specific sector or issue, the main hindrance towards reforms is the typical systematic inheritance of the lack of urgency on the part of the key policy actors. Naturally, without strong and sustained advocacy initiatives the larger goal would be jeopardized. Therefore, parallelly with the technical support for analyzing budgets, CAPPS also intends to make dents in the process with a well-designed systematic advocacy providing wider space for the common people to participate in the policy discussion. Thus, focusing on the pro-poor and pro-marginalized budgetary and policy issues, CAPPS intends to empower a wide range of stakeholders and build considerable pressure on the elected forums to reorient policy priorities in favour of the poor and marginalized sections.

			<ul class="collection with-header">
		        <li class="collection-item">
		        	Develop district and block level hubs of CSOs interested in this work. CAPPS will provide a useful infrastructure for sharing data and good practices, delivering trainings and monitoring performances.
		        </li>
		        <li class="collection-item">
		        	CAPPS will link the grant support to the well-conceived diagnostic work and provide an excellent learning experience for donors and grantees, particularly in the areas of institutional management and development, policy, institutional environment within which they operate.
		        </li>
		        <li class="collection-item">
		        	CAPPS believe that the typical nature of governance is multi-layered. Therefore, the coordination should be at multiple levels. Naturally, simply producing persuasive analysis will not be sufficient unless encouraged to better leverage other ‘accountability mechanisms’ such as the news media, courts, legislators and other CSOs. CAPPS will deliver towards this direction.It must be noted at this juncture that, CAPPS has the advantage of being headquartered in the heart of Kolkata having all possible avenues for better communication and promotion of public relations.
		        </li>
		        <li class="collection-item">CAPPS intends to encourage the mode of engagement through accumulation and dissemination of information, rather than taking a confrontation mode. Using these means, CAPPS with an attempt to make actual collaboration with public officials. Needless to mention that, if the public officials could be made active for analytical work by fully understanding the thinking behind such analysis it would add value to the vision and mission of CAPPS in several ways. For example, they might acknowledge the reliability of such interventions and response more pro-actively.  Instances are there where simply generating reports by outside organization without proper stakeholding of the partners often failed to generate the desired outcome.</li>

			CAPPS is confident that the interventions proposed will result in substantial progress over the short term (within 2 years), medium term (within 5 year) and long term (beyond 5 year). By the end of the 5th year CAPPS expect to have well established district and block level networks along with a robust base of enhanced capacity of the public and related stakeholders through these participating organizations. Thus, such activities of CAPPS will provide strong credentials for seeking and utilizing funds from both domestic and international donors. As a long term goal, CAPPS intends to expand it capacity building activities beyond West Bengal.<br><br>

			Now, to set up CAPPS within a formal framework, it is seeking for prudent donors to provide CAPPS with the initial seed social investment for at least the coming 5 years, which is upto 2021 starting from 2016. This funding is expected to cover the salaries of the staffs, generating people friendly analytical research outputs, printing, advocacy campaigns across the districts and blocks and other minimum administrative expenditures to run an organization. Over the years, CAPPS shall try to make it sustainable by its own credibility earned during these initial years.
